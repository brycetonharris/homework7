This Java program uses the bubble sort method to effectively sort an array.

Comments in program describe each step along the way.

The proggram asks for user input,
- Length of Array
- File Name of Array
- File Name of Sorted Array

It then sorts the array and creates two files, printing the un-sorted array 
in one. In the other exists the sorted array.
